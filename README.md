# Five Nights At 51
Five Nights At 51 is a Unity game currently in development. It is a parody of a Five Nights at Freddyâ€™s game but involves escaped aliens at Area 51. Additionally, the roles of the game are reversed: the user plays as the aliens attempting to reach the security room while avoiding the view of randomly operating security cameras. 
# How to run the program
The program can be run on Unity version 2022.3.1f1 (download here: https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2022.3.1).
# Current State and Future Plans
Currently the game is still in development. Following are the unfinished components:
- Camera debugging
- Raycast recognition for security cameras to accurately spot aliens
- Combining cameras, map, title screen, and game over screen
- Adjusting lighting and viewing to improve player experience
- Implement audio effects and music
